# Challenge 01: Positive

This project is a **responsive landing page** for a ride-sharing app, created as part of my learning journey in web
development. The objective was to adapt the **desktop-only layout** from a [previous project](https:://github.com/ipaulaa/positive)
into a design that works on both **mobile** and **desktop** screens, while applying new concepts learned in
responsive web design.
